# hello-world
the first in a series of steps designed to make sure i don't fail this class.

Hello! I am a little bit overwhelmed right now, but I'm trying. My favorite things are books, hugs, the TV show Riverdale, spending moneyt on things I can't afford, my mom, Tucson, Arizona; collecting vinyl, my boyfriend, McNuggets, and my friends, who are supportive AF.
